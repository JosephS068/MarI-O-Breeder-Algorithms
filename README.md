# MarI-O-Breeder-Algorithms

In the original [source](https://github.com/mam91/Neat-Genetic-Mario), the breeder genetic algorithm was implemented. For my project I implemented three additional genetic algorithms and compared results of all four types. The results can be found in project.pdf. 

To get running download and follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/mam91/Neat-Genetic-Mario). At step 8, choose on the scripts from this repository.
